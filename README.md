PHP MVC framework built with infuse/libs

## What is Infuse?

Infuse Framework is an incredibly powerful tool for building a modern web application that is built on top of [infuse/libs](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse-libs). The goal of Infuse is to bring scalable simplicity to web development. The framework follows MVC conventions and scaffolds a REST API + administrator dashboard for models.

## Features

- MVC pattern
- Modular
- Built-in authentication
- Optional modules for [OAuth](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse-oauth), [Facebook](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse-facebook), and [Twitter](https://github.com/jaredtking/infuse-twitter) authentication
- Robust permissions system
- Database agnostic with PDO
- Flexible URL routing
- Automatic REST API for models
- Dashboard to view, create, edit, and delete models
- Schema generation
- Templating with [Smarty](http://smarty.net)
- CSS asset minification with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- Javascript minification
- Logging with [monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)

## Requirements

- PHP >= 5.3
- [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
- PDO supported data store
- mod_rewrite (if using apache)

### Optional

- memcached (for built-in model caching)
- redis (for sessions)

## Demo

A demo has been setup at [infuse.jaredtking.com](http://infuse.jaredtking.com).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install with composer

```
composer create-project infuse/infuse ./path/to/dir
```

Infuse Framework is served through the `public` directory to prevent the framework files from being served. This requires a small amount of configuration for the web server to work properly.

### 2. nginx

Here is a sample configuration:

```nginx
server {
	listen 80;

 	server_name example.com;

	root /var/www/example.com/public;

	access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com-access.log;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com-error.log;
	
	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?q=$uri&$args;
	}

	location ~ \.php$ {
		fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
		fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
		include        fastcgi_params;
	}
}
```

### 2. apache

A .htaccess file is already included in the `/public` directory for url rewrites. You must also make sure that `DocumentRoot` points to `{FRAMEWORK_PATH}/public`.

### 3. Installer

Fire up the url where the framework is installed and you will be redirected to an installer to setup the database and `config.php`.

### 4. Cron Jobs (optional)

If you wish to use the built-in `cron` module then you must setup a cron job for Infuse Framework.

```bash
*	*	*	*	*	php /var/www/example.com/public/index.php /cron/scheduleCheck
```

## Why another MVC framework?

Infuse has served me well on many projects in the past, which makes this a highly opinionated framework. My aim is to make this available for the benefit of others. If something does not look right, I would love to hear about it in the issues.
